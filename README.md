The project is based on a static front-end using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies and implemented based on user experience design, accessibility and responsiveness. I have designed this website on a bespoke basis for a kitchen named "The Kitchen" situated in Kent. it is a virtual kitchen where people can reserve their meal and deliver it to their doorstep. Their service will promote in this unprecedented time and stand unique.

<h2 align="center">Sitemap</h2>
<hr>
At this first stage, I think about what information, pages, features to determine the business goals and user needs and align all the features with the strategy. I wanted a simple design so that the potential customers would not feel overwhelmed by the pages. 
The Kitchen website is a static front end project written in HTML and CSS programming language with main five pages. The top five pages such as:

* [HOME](<home>)
* ABOUT US
* MENU
* MY ACCOUNT 
* CONTACT

The menu page has been divided into three pages as

* THE KITCHEN'S MENU
* RESERVE A MEAL 
* DOWNLOAD OUR MENU

* HOME 

    Upon entering the home page, the users are greeted with a clear and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of the user choice. Underneath, there is an image with some text and a "Reserve a meal" call to action button. The user can click on the call to action button or scroll down to find an overview of the restaurant's head chef, a slideshow with images and Contact details, and other helpful links to know more about the restaurant.

    [Homepage-Wireframe](assets/images/wireframe-homepage.png)

* ABOUT US

    Upon entering the about us page, the users are greeted with a clear and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of the user choice. There is a callout image with the heading "About Us" when scrolling down a more in-depth explanation of the restaurant, testimonials, opening times, contact details and other helpful links to know more about the restaurant.
   
    [AboutUs-Wireframe](assets/images/aboutus-wireframe.png)
 
* MENU

   Upon entering the menu page, the page has been designed with a drop-down menu system with the other three pages: "The Kitchen's menu, Reserve a meal, Download our menu". Different contents separate each page. When entering the menu page of The Kitchen, users are welcomed with a clear and easy-to-read navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Like the other pages,  a callout image is titled "Menu". As the user scrolls down, potential customers can view a more in-depth description of the current restaurant menu and the prices. Adopting a translucent strategy in this regard will increase customer faithfulness. The footer area contains contact details and other helpful links to learn more about the restaurant when scrolling down.

   When entering the reserve a meal page, users are held with a clear and easy-to-read navigation bar to go to the page of their preference. Like the other pages,  a callout image is titled with some text. As the user scrolls down, there is a reservation form for filling to book a meal. The footer area contains contact details and other helpful links. The third page of download our menu allows users to download the menu on their device to spend less time on the internet to find their meal.

<h2 align="center">Design</h2>
<hr>

* Colour Scheme

  The sensory strategy section of a website is the design of how users see and experience it. I wanted the design to be clean and easy for everyone to access; the colours should not be too dark and give it purity, joy, and creativity. Most of the places I use here are two colours, black and white, which are often associated with luxury and elite trademarks. It is not only used for elegance, sophistication and style. These colours like to communicate with people and target audiences, aiming to gain more traction.
  Also, throughout the project, I have used bootstrap colour utilities that support me with styling links and buttons with hover states. I make sure all the contents of the text are visible.

* Typography

  Throughout the web, I have used the Cormorant Garamond font family. If the font is not adequately imported to the site, Serif is used as the fallback font for some reason. 

* Imagery

  I have used essential images throughout the site to catch the user's attention. Some are created on Canvas, and some are downloaded from Pexels.

* Styling Components

  Before starting the development, I listed some styling ideas that encouraged me to simplify things, and I thought they would be helpful for the website. So the features are controlled and straightforward. Therefore, throughout the site, all content was made responsive. It was very successful; I used bootstrap elements such as navbar, dropdown, jumbotron, carousel, cards, forms, buttons, and alerts elsewhere throughout the page.

<h2 align="center">Technologies</h2>
<hr>

Throughout the milestone project, I used several techniques that led me to success.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

HTML provides the structure of a web page. HTML contains elements that tell the browser how to display content.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

CSS is the language employed in the style of HTML documents.CSS defines how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)

Bootstrap is responsive and the world's most widespread framework for building mobile-first sites. For this project, I have used the v4.6 version. For developing my site more responsive, I have used several bootstrap components.
  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

I used an open-source code hosting platform named GitHub. I created a repository for developing my site. It helps me store and manage my code and track and control changes to my codes. 

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

Gitpod is an online Integrated Development environment that can be launched from any GitHub page that will help me manage the rebuild projects or create a new project based on the GitHub repository. Once I code, I will commit to GitHub.

- [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/)

To make my website more beautiful, I added Google Fonts, which are released under open source licenses. I added the font family name Cormorant Garamond in a CSS style sheet for applying the font. 

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/)

Font Awesome is a scalable vector icon built using the power of CSS. Through this pictorial language, I have described web-related activities in many places.

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

This is a wireframe tool. This creates the structure of the website before coding.

- [AmIResponsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is)

This tool displays how the built-in website responds across different browsers. I have used this to show in my README overview and added a screenshot.

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

I used to customize some logo and images for my website.

- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

I used royalty-free pictures for my projects.

- [W3CMarkupValidationService](https://validator.w3.org/)

It is a free service by W3C that helps check the validity of Web documents.

<h2 align="center">Testing</h2>
<hr>

### W3C Validator

I validated HTML and CSS using the W3 validation service. The results are as follows:

- [Homepage](assets/Testing/home.png)

- [AboutUspage](assets/Testing/aboutus.png)

- [Menupage](assets/Testing/menupage.png)

On the menu page, there was a warning; I changed the heading size from h1 to h2 and erased that warning. The result is on the below link.

- [Menupage](assets/Testing/menupage2.png)

- [ReserveMealpage](assets/Testing/reservemeal.png)

- [MyAccountpage](assets/Testing/myaccount.png)

- [Contactpage](assets/Testing/contact.png)

- [CSS-Stylesheet](assets/Testing/cssstylesheet.png)

### Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools

To find the quality of web pages, I used an open-source called [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools) in Chrome DevTools. It has checked for performance, progressive Web apps, best practices, accessibility and SEO. The generated Lighthouse result on each page is shown below:

- [Homepage](assets/Testing/home-lighthouse.png)

- [AboutUspage](assets/Testing/aboutus-lighthouse.png)

- [Menupage](assets/Testing/menupage-lighthouse.png)

- [ReserveMealpage](assets/Testing/reservemeal-lighthouse.png)

- [MyAcountpage](assets/Testing/myaccount-lighthouse.png)

- [Contactpage](assets/Testing/contact-lighthouse.png)

### Responsive

* To check the responsiveness I used Chrome Developer Tools. There are numerous lists of emulated devices. 
* Personally I checked on my home devices such as iMac, iphone 12 mini, Accer Chromebook and iphone 6S.

### Issues to overcome

For the better performance of the site, I have to set background and foreground colours in a correct contrast ratio. Some of the texts in the footer I coded as text-muted, I have to set for improving the legibility of the content. The image sizes have to be appropriately sized so I can improve the loading time. 

<hr>
<h2 align="center">Deployment</h2>
<hr>

### Deployed my project to GitHub

The site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed straight from the main branch of GitHub. The deployed site will modernise automatically as new commits are pushed to the main branch. The below steps explains how I deployed my Github pages.

- First got to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Sign in with your username and password
- Click on your repositories 
- Find your selected repository from the repositories
- Click on settings on the tab
- On settings go to Pages
- In GitHub pages select the source to main branch and save it. 

Once saved the site will publish and the new URL for the deployed site will show us. 

For additional information [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Create a local clone of my project

- Under the repository click on code button
- In the Clone copy HTTP URL
- Move the current working directory to the location you want to create.
- Type git clone and paste the HTTP URL and press enter

The local clone will be ready.

<h2 align="center">Credits</h2>

* My husband is a chef by profession, and he was very supportive in preparing the menu. Many of his suggestions helped me to build this site. 

* I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp) sites to help me throughout my coding journey. Moreover, I guided all learning modules from the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/).

* The photos and images were used from Pexels and designed by myself through Cava. 

* I used the [W3Cvalidator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check if my website meets the code formatting criteria.

* To find the quality of web pages, I used an open-source called [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools) in Chrome DevTools.

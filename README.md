The project is based on a static front-end using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies and implemented based on user experience design, accessibility and responsiveness. I have designed this website on a bespoke basis for a restaurant called "The Kitchen" situated in Kent. it is a virtual restaurant where people can reserve their meal and deliver it to their doorstep. Their service will promote in this unprecedented time and stand unique.

<h2>Sitemap</h2>
<hr>
At this first stage, I think about what information, pages, features to determine the business goals and user needs and align all the features with the strategy. I wanted a simple design so that the potential customers would not feel overwhelmed by the pages. 
The Kitchen website is a static front end project written in HTML and CSS programming language with main five pages. The top five pages such as:

* HOME
* ABOUT US
* MENU
* MY ACCOUNT 
* CONTACT

The menu page has been divided into three pages as

* THE KITCHEN'S MENU
* RESERVE A MEAL 
* DOWNLOAD OUR MENU

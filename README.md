The project is based on a static front-end using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies and implemented based on user experience design, accessibility and responsiveness. I have designed this website on a bespoke basis for a restaurant called "The Kitchen" situated in Kent. it is a virtual restaurant where people can reserve their meal and deliver it to their doorstep. Their service will promote in this unprecedented time and stand unique.

At this first stage, I think about what information, pages, features to determine the business goals and user needs and align all the features with the strategy. I wanted a simple design so that the potential customers would not feel overwhelmed by the pages. 
The Kitchen website is a static front end project written in HTML and CSS programming language with main five pages. The top five pages such as:

* HOME
* ABOUT US
* MENU
* MY ACCOUNT 
* CONTACT

The menu page has been divided into three pages as

* THE KITCHEN'S MENU
* RESERVE A MEAL 
* DOWNLOAD OUR MENU

* HOME 

    Upon entering the home page, the users are greeted with a clear and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of the user choice. Underneath, there is an image with some text and a "Reserve a meal" call to action button. The user can click on the call to action button or scroll down to find an overview of the restaurant's head chef, a slideshow with images and Contact details, and other helpful links to know more about the restaurant.

    Upon entering the about us page, the users are greeted with a clear and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of the user choice. There is a callout image with the heading "About Us" when scrolling down a more in-depth explanation of the restaurant, testimonials, opening times, contact details and other helpful links to know more about the restaurant.

* MENU

   Upon entering the menu page, the page has been designed with a drop-down menu system with the other three pages: "The Kitchen's menu, Reserve a meal, Download our menu". Different contents separate each page. When entering the menu page of The Kitchen, users are welcomed with a clear and easy-to-read navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Like the other pages,  a callout image is titled "Menu". As the user scrolls down, potential customers can view a more in-depth description of the current restaurant menu and the prices. Adopting a translucent strategy in this regard will increase customer faithfulness. The footer area contains contact details and other helpful links to learn more about the restaurant when scrolling down.

<h2 align="center">Design</h2>

* Colour Scheme

The sensory strategy section of a website is the design of how users see and experience it. I wanted the design to be clean and easy for everyone to access; the colours should not be too dark and give it purity, joy, and creativity. Most of the places I use here are two colours, black and white, which are often associated with luxury and elite trademarks. It is not only used for elegance, sophistication and style. These colours like to communicate with people and target audiences, aiming to gain more traction.
Also, throughout the project, I have used bootstrap colour utilities that support me with styling links and buttons with hover states. I make sure all the contents of the text are visible.

* Typography

Throughout the web, I have used the Cormorant Garamond font family. If the font is not adequately imported to the site, Serif is used as the fallback font for some reason. 

* Imagery

I have used essential images throughout the site to catch the user's attention. Some are created on Canvas, and some are downloaded from Pexels.

* Styling Components

Before starting the development, I listed some styling ideas that encouraged me to simplify things, and I thought they would be helpful for the website. So the features are controlled and straightforward. Therefore, throughout the site, all content was made responsive. It was very successful; I used bootstrap elements such as navigation navbar, dropdown, jumbotron, carousel, cards, forms, buttons, and alerts elsewhere throughout the page.
